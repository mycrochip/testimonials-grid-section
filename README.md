## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I got to practice more with the Grid Layout and make elements span multiple lines.
I also got to understand the effect of leaving grid-template-rows as the default value auto. All elements within the grid get to depend on one another for their sizes.


### Continued development

More projects to be completed on [FrotendEnd Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)
